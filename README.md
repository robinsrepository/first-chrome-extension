# My First Chrome Extension ðŸ§©

## Description
I'm following the "Learn JavaScript" course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home) right now and this is the third part of it.
By building a Chrome Extension I'm learning more basics of JavaScript.

## Features
This Chrome Extension allows users to save URL's by passing them into an input field or by directly saving the tab that they are looking at.
The URL's are then displayed inside of the extension and they are saved inside the local storage of the browser.

## Remarks
This is the first project I'm writing using GitHub Desktop, because I just learned how to create a local Dev environment with commit, push and deploy.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
3. Enjoy exploring the different Canvas projects!

## Live Version
You can view the live version of the project here: [Live Demo](https://robinsrepository.github.io/first-chrome-extension/)
